<h7>Sample Profiles and Best Practices<br></h7><br>
<p>
    Creating your profile is the first step toward developing meaningful relationships with clients. This is your spotlight to share your talents and interests. But even more than that, this is where you show clients how you can help them complete their projects and grow their business.<br><br>

Fully completing your profile also helps us match you with more relevant projects. We also require a complete profile for you to be eligible to achieve Rising Talent or Top Rated status. But what does a top-notch profile look like?<br><br>

One of the easiest ways to get started is to focus on the basics. Choose work categories that are most relevant to your skill set. Set an hourly rate that reflects your skills and experience level. <br><br>

If you’re not sure what to charge, you can research other freelancers on WorkUp to get an idea of what others with similar skills are billing in your industry. For more details about how to complete these items and other parts of your profile, go here.<br><br>

Then, consider these tips to help enhance your profile and ensure it showcases your experience and expertise in the best light.
</p>
<br><br>
<h7>Pro tips to make your profile stand out<br></h7><br>
<p>
Make your profile about your clients. How can you help them?<br><br>
Be consistent with your strongest skills and leverage all profile sections (Title, Skills, Overview, Work History) to back them up.<br><br>
Help establish trust and confidence by completing all sections.<br><br>
Be concise and straightforward in your language.<br><br>
Proofread each section carefully.<br><br>
Link other professional accounts in your profile settings to help us match you better to jobs. Update your profile regularly.<br><br>
Update your profile visibility if your profile has been switched to “private” due to inactivity.<br><br>
Keep a perfect responsiveness score by replying quickly to invitations and messages.<br><br>
Update your profile to “available” when you are, so that you receive invites. When you’re not, set your profile to “not available” to avoid unwanted messages or a decreased responsiveness score due to non-response.<br><br>
Before you publish your profile, ask friends to give you feedback. Another good idea is to read your profile out loud: It’s a great way to see if your profile flows well, has a nice rhythm, and sounds like you.<br><br>
</p>

<h7>Application to Join Upwork Declined<br></h7><br>
<p>
    We understand that building a freelance business on Upwork is important to you, and that you may be frustrated when we decline your application.<br><br>

As remote working becomes more popular, the marketplace becomes more competitive. We receive over 10,000 applications daily, and we try to keep a balance between freelancers and projects available. Because we want you to find jobs and succeed, if our marketplace doesn't currently have opportunities for your combination of skills and experience, we won’t accept your application at that time.<br><br>

Don’t worry, though –– you can update your profile and reapply if you have other relevant skills or experience to add that you may have left off your first application. Plus, the opportunities for people with your skills may change, so you’re welcome to reapply again later. You can also find ways to improve your profile here.<br><br>

You can also look at job postings to see what kind of projects are trending. Learning or improving skills that are in high demand is one way to become more competitive. You may also have skills that you didn’t realize were marketable on Upwork and that you could add to your profile.<br>
</p>
<br><br>
<h7>Feature your best work<br></h7><br>
<p>
    Your portfolio is another great way to show potential clients what you can do for them.<br><br> Use your portfolio to attract attention and showcase the quality of your work plus the value of your expertise.<br><br>

    Choose pieces that reflect your niche and help display your specialization. If your skills aren’t particularly visual,<br><br>try to find creative ways to explain the challenge behind each sample and how your work had an impact.<br><br>
